        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Having a bad day? Need some comfort food to brighten up your life? Want your family to stuff their faces so you can have a moment of silence? Looking for something quick and easy to cook dinner because this isn't the 1960s where you have all day to cook?</p>
        <p>You've come to the right place! This homemade mac and cheese recipe is a fan favorite in my home.  The kids love it and I don't want to pull my hair out trying to follow a drawn out recipe rule book to cook it!</p>
        <p>Enough with the chit chat. Let's get down to business.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>16 ounces uncooked white elbow pasta</li>
                <li>4 cups water</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt <em>(or to taste)</em></li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon pepper <em>(or to taste)</em></li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>8 ounces sharp white cheddar cheese <em>(about 2 cups shredded)</em></li>
                <li>4 ounces sharp cheddar cheese <em>(about 1 cup shredded)</em></li>
                <li>½ cup milk <em>(warmed)</em></li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place pasta, water, salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder into the Instant Pot. Stir ingredients well and even out the pasta to make sure it is all submerged.</li>
                <li>Close the Instant Pot lid and move the steam release valve to the sealing position. Pressure Cook at high pressure for 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the pasta is cooking, shred the cheese (if you didn't buy pre-shredded cheese) and warm the milk.</li>
                <li>When the cook time ends, quick release the pressure by moving the steam release valve to the venting position.</li>
                <li>Once all steam has been released and the pin drops down, open the Instant Pot lid. Add the butter and slowly stir in the cheese. Next, add in the milk.</li>
                <li>If the mac and cheese seems too watery, keep it on the warm setting for a few minutes and it will thicken. Taste and serve.</li>
            </ol>
