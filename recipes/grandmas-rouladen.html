        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prep ingredients</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325Â°F</li>
                <li>Lay the beef slices out on a work surface. Spread each beef slice with 2 teaspoons of mustard and sprinkle with a dash of salt and ground pepper.</li>
                <li>Place a strip of bacon on each beef slice parallel to the length of the beef. Place sliced pickles and chopped onions on each slice of beef.</li>
                <li>Roll up the beef slices, tucking in the sides as you go. Secure the beef rolls with toothpicks.</li>
                <li>Heat the butter and oil in a dutch oven <em>or oven-safe pot or baking dish</em> and brown the rouladen generously on all sides. Set the rouladen aside on a plate.</li>
                <li>*Do not remove the browned bits in the bottom of the pan (as this will make for a flavourful gravy).</li>
                <li>Add the onions to the pot and cook until softened and translucent - <em>appoximately 5 minutes</em>. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
                <li>Add the leek, carrot and celery to the pot and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the red wine and bring to a rapid boil for one minute. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 2-3 minutes.</li> 
                <li>Add the beef broth, tomato paste, bay leaf, sugar, salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Nestle the beef rouladen in the pot.
                <li>Transfer the oven-safe pot to the preheated oven and bake for about 90 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the rouladen from the pot and set aside.</li>
                <li>Pour the liquid and vegetables through a strainer and save the liquid.</li>
                <li>Return the strained liquid back to the pot and bring to a simmer. 
                <li>Mix 2TBSP cornstarch with 2TBSP water and add to the pot to thicken the gravy. Simmer <em>wisking consistently</em> until the gravy has thickened.</li> 
                <li>Add chilled butter, whisking constantly, until the butter is melted. Add salt, pepper and mustard to taste.</li>
                <li>Carefully remove the toothpicks. Return rouladen to the gravy and heat through.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
