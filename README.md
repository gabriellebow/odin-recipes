# odin-recipes
This is a project where I created a page dedicated to recipes.  I utilized GitHub to create a repository, used the terminal to retrieve said repository, as well as created directories and files for the project.  From there, I used Visual Studio Code to create my main page (index.html - Odin Recipes) which is where I inserted links to move to the pages dedicated to each recipe. Under each recipe page, I created unordered and ordered lists as well as inserted pictures to showcase the food.
